abstract: The tie-knotting task is highly challenging due to the tie’s high deformation
  and long-horizon manipulation actions. This work presents TieBot, a Real-to-Sim-to-Real
  learning from visual demonstration system for the robots to learn to knot a tie.
  We introduce the Hierarchical Feature Matching approach to estimate a sequence of
  tie’s meshes from the demonstration video. With these estimated meshes used as subgoals,
  we first learn a teacher policy using privileged information. Then, we learn a student
  policy with point cloud observation by imitating teacher policy. Lastly, our pipeline
  applies learned policy to real-world execution. We demonstrate the effectiveness
  of TieBot in simulation and the real world. In the real-world experiment, a dual-arm
  robot successfully knots a tie, achieving 50% success rate among 10 trials. Videos
